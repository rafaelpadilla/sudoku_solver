# 🎯 Sudoku Solver 🧩

## 📖 About This Project

This is a special project that I created **with my dad on December 25th, 2025** 🎄✨. It started as a fun discussion about sudoku's solving strategies that I used to teach my dad the basics of algorithms and Python programming!

### 🎓 The Story

My dad has always been interested in puzzles, and he bought several Sudoku books (hard level) that he couldn't solve. Together, we decided to explore whether **any Sudoku puzzle can be solved** using an algorithm that "he created" 🙃! 

Just sharing for fun, and using as an opportunity to explain him what an open source code project is.

I encourage everyone to do the same with their beloved ones.
